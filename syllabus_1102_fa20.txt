### Syllabus:  History 1102- World History from 1400 to 1914 with Jack Norton ###

_“You can best serve civilization by being against what usually passes for it.”_ Wendell Berry

_“Learning is always rebellion . . . Every bit of new truth discovered is revolutionary to what was believed before.”_ Margaret Lee Runbeck

**Welcome** to World History. We will be doing what is called digital history for our course. That is, we will study the past by using computing technologies (mostly webpages) to create digital projects. I assume you are able to operate a computer (turn it on, open a browser) and no more.

There are no prerequisites for this course, and you do *not* need any specialized knowledge. The class will be taught in English, with occasional cheesy jokes and mild vulgarities in Spanish.  

Studying history has changed dramatically in the last 20 years. People publish more lies about the past than evidence-based history. For your parents, finding historical information was the challenge. For you, sorting credible from non-credible information will be the defining feature of your historical work, and indeed your information life.  

I want you to learn about the past, learn new skills about how to analyze and present about the past, and learn new ways of _how_ to learn (called meta-cognition). The learning goals, or outcomes, fit in these three groups. The goals for this course are below. I may sometimes call these learning outcomes, or the stuff I want you to be able to do by the end of this course.  

1.  Demonstrate a broad understanding of World History from the early modern period through the modern era.

2. Make use of historical thinking.

3.  Analyze historical sources, distinguishing primary from secondary sources.  

4.  Communicate effectively using historical evidence and methods.

5.  Analyze and understand the diversity of peoples within their distinctive historical contexts.  

6. Develop strategies for advancing your learning skills, such as effective reading, writing, acquiring new digital skills and critically analyzing historical sources.
    
7.  Demonstrate an understanding of the ethics of acquiring, using, and presenting historical sources, as articulated by both professional organizations and historical subjects.

**Course Policies**

**COVID Notice**

The regular grading policies in this syllabus provide that a student could miss two weeks of class and suffer no grade penalty. If you or a family member you care for are hospitalized by COVID or any other debilitating disease, we can work on a schedule to allow you make up an additional two weeks of material. There will be no making up material beyond those four weeks. 

**Attendance- Attendance is required!** You need to check in with our course regularly throughout the week. In my face-to-face courses I take attendance. For online courses, I expect you to read, post, and otherwise contribute to D2L at least five times a week. The course grades are set up to reward students who work regularly on our course up and penalize students who do not. For example, there are no late assignments. 

**Assignments and Grades**

| Grade Items      | Weighted Percentages | Due Day                 |

| Opening Quizzes  | 20                   | Sunday                  |
| Lab Experiment   | 30                   | Thursday                |
| Lab Consultation | 10                   | Wednesday (Online)      |

Grades in this course are *weighted.* To understand how this works, see [this explanation](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-weighted-score-3212065). 

Each week you start by taking a quiz on the reading for the WEEK AHEAD, which is due by Sunday night at 8 p.m. You will then work on a history experiment Monday-Wednesday, consulting with another classmate, and turning in your mini-project and a summary of your conversation Wednesday night.  By Thursday night you will reflect on what you learned in your project, and by Friday night you will take a closing quiz. 

* Quizzes will be open book, 5-8 multiple choice questions and one primary source analysis (short answer. ) 
* Labs will attempt to answer a question about the past using digital tools that I will teach you how to use. The homework of labs is split into three parts: the *experiment* that attempts to answer the question, the *consultation*, that records you and another student talking about how to do the experiment, and the *reflection*, that asks you to consider what you learned and how well you did the experiment.    
* ONLINE STUDENTS: The experiment, consultation, and reflection will all be submitted in the discussion part of D2L.  
* You will note there is no mid-term or final. One of the organizing ideas of this course is that by increasing the weekly work load slightly and making it predictable, I can help students retain information faster by avoiding cramming or big crunches for major projects.   

**BONUS:** Bug hunt- If you find an error in any course materials that can affect learning (a broken link, an omitted word that changes the meaning of an assignment), please email me with "bug hunt" in the subject line. I'll give you an extra 1% on your next assignment. Reporting minor bugs, such as a mis-formatted web page or non-learning related spelling error, earn my thanks.

**E-Learning- What you need to know**– *You must use your student email for all emails to me*. Despite the digital methods of this history course, this is NOT a learn at your own pace course. The due dates for assignments are final, though I do drop your lowest two scores in each category. Online-only education allows you to learn without coming to campus, but it is in fact a more demanding form of college. Online-only students need to be a reasonably skilled keyboardists and comfortable with computer technology. If the words upload, download, install, or  "As Fatima mentioned in her post on technology. . . " are foreign to you, an online-only course might not be the course for you. I want you to succeed, which is why I want you to be honest with yourself about your abilities. Face-to-face courses let me offer real-time support and are generally easier (or so report my students). 

For all my students, to succeed in this course you will need to:

-   Turn on a computer and open a browser. 

-   Watch streaming video from pgs.org and other websites.

-   Navigate the Normandale Library website successfully.

-   Spell check everything.
    
For online only, you need to be able to:

-  Download and install software on your computer.

-  Recognize that written communication requires more careful word choice than oral communication. For example, sarcastic comments don’t work because you can’t read sarcasm, only hear it. 

If you need technology help, you may call our IT help desk at 952-358-8181.  Even better, ask them a question on Normandale's “[*Ask Us*](http://normandale.custhelp.com/app/home)” page, which will help track your request.  

**Late Work-** There is no late work. Instead, your lowest two scores are dropped in each category. 

**Reading and Writing-** This is a reading and writing-intensive course. You will read up to 75 pages a week and write at least 16 pages of typed, doubled-spaced pages of text (total, not all at once). Writing guidelines for each assignment will be discussed in course and included on the assignment.  

**Written work** will be in the D2L discussion box and submitted using outside websites.  I strongly encourage students to keep a file of their work outside of D2L and not rely on the D2L composing windows for anything. For one of your assignments I will train you to use [plain text](http://www.monkeyjob.com/FAQ/What-Plain-Text-File.htm) in the [Markdown](<http://commonmark.org/help/>) syntax. When it comes to formatting your own writing, I assume you know how to turn on a computer, and open a web browser. Everything else I will teach you how to do with careful instructions and diligent follow-ups.

**Assessment:** Assessment means measuring your learning, I can do this by asking you questions, indicating if your answers are correct or not, and giving you a grade. Grades are you way I assess your learning. I can also assess you learning by teaching you the tools of historical thinking, having you build historical arguments, and then and then asking you to evaluate your work. Both grading and self evaluation will be key elements of assessing your learning. 

#### Academic Standards ####

Students in this course will adhere to the rules of Normandale Community College’s Code of Conduct. Such rules prohibit plagiarizing other’s work (taking credit for someone else’s work or stealing work from the web) and creating a hostile academic environment for students or staff. Refer to your student handbook for the full Student Code of Conduct or see: [here](http://www.normandale.edu/current-students/code-of-conduct). We will work through how to properly cite material during the semester. Please be aware that the penalty for plagiarism is failure of the assignment, then possibly the course, and possibly dismissal from the College.

**Writing Resource-** You are encouraged to use Normandale’s Writing Center as you create and rewrite your assignments. It is located in the central hallway between College Services and Fine Arts buildings. *All* good writers revise their work. Writing tutors can help you at any stage of writing. The Writing Center is in the College Services Building on the 2nd floor: no appointments necessary- walk in and ask for help.

### Why are grades on D2L but most of the course material are on jacknorton.org? ###

The Federal Education Rights Privacy Act requires that all computer systems with access to private student data (like your grades) have  a secure login. I'm not willing to create  this type of system, so we use D2L for those items related to grades. For everything else, having the course available on the open web is a superior option. If you want to know more, please see me. The tl;dr is that the open web is better for access, accountability, and responsive teaching. 

**Changes?**
Changes will be announced on our course [website]().

I reserve the right to amend this syllabus to better facilitate students’ learning. Changes to the syllabus (if any) will be announced in the news section and an amended syllabus will be posted on the class website.
